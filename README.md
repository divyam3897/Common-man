# Project:

## HINT Team Name: sudo!!

## Problem statement:
The everyday problem of most of the common man houses: "Beta aj dudh khatam hogya h!! Tumse itna sam kam ni hota ki lekar aao!!" (Son, there is no milk in the house and you can't even do the job of bringing it everyday.) This is one problem that happens at every "Common's man" residence. It's not easy for people having daily jobs to do their jobs and maintain the house. There are cabs for travelling, large ecommerce websites for ordering stuff but who will get milk, bread, flour and the things that the common man of today needs everyday??

## Solution:
Here is a solution to all the common man needs. No need to keep track of your needs anymore and worry for the daily hassle.
We would provide all the accessories, needs that you would need ranging from your breakfast milk to your green tea to your face cream and face wash. Still worried about remembering the things? We have a subscription for you as a solution. Subscribe to milk for everyday and our vendor will be at your door every morning. It's not limited to just your daily needs. You get holi colors at the time of "Holi" and "rakhi" for your brothers at raksha bandhan in our festivals section. 
It's a store for your daily needs. It's a common app for a common app with common needs :)
